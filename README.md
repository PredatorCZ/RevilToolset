# RevilToolset

Revil Toolset is a collection of modding tools for RE Engine/MT Framework titles.

## SPACConvert

Extracts and converts contents of SPAC archives.\
This app uses multithreading, so you can process multiple files at the same time. Best way is to drag'n'drop files onto app.
For this reason a .config file is placed alongside executable file, since app itself only takes file paths as arguments.
A .config file is in XML format. \
***Please do not create any spaces/tabs/uppercase letters/commas as decimal points within setting field. \
Program must run at least once to generate .config file.***
